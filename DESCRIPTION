Title: A Fair Pre-Processing Procedure - Fair Adaptation
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Drago Plecko
Maintainer: Drago Plecko <drago.plecko@stat.math.ethz.ch>
Description: An implementation of the Fair Adaptation Procedures described in
    Plecko & Meinshausen (2019) <arXiv:https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.01659.pdf> . 
    The adaptation procedure uses the specified causal graph to pre-process the 
    given training and testing data in such a way to remove the bias caused by 
    the protected attribute. The procedure uses tree ensembles for quantile 
    regression.
