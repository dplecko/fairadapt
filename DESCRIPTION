Title: Fair Data Adaptation with Quantile Preservation
Description: An implementation of the fair data adaptation with quantile
    preservation described in Plecko & Meinshausen (2019) <arXiv:1911.06685>.
    The adaptation procedure uses the specified causal graph to pre-process the
    given training and testing data in such a way to remove the bias caused by
    the protected attribute. The procedure uses tree ensembles for quantile
    regression.
