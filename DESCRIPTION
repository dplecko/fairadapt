Description: An implementation of the fair data adaptation with quantile preservation described in
    Plecko & Meinshausen (2019) <arXiv:1911.06685>. 
    The adaptation procedure uses the specified causal graph to pre-process the 
    given training and testing data in such a way to remove the bias caused by 
    the protected attribute. The procedure uses tree ensembles for quantile 
    regression.
